nycOpenDataForce
================

D3 Force-directed graph of NYC's Open Data.  Data is pulled via SODA (Socrata Open Data API) from NYC's dataset of datasets.  JavaScript munging locates "original datasets" (created by NYC, not user-created views). Original datasets are placed below categories, user-created views are placed below their parent.   This new structure is used to create a force-directed graph in D3.
